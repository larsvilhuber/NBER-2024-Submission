	abstract = {This paper explores the consequences for economic research of methods used by data publishers to protect the privacy of their respondents. We review the concept of statistical disclosure limitation for an audience of economists who may be unfamiliar with these methods. We characterize what it means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable. When it is not ignorable, we consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for a variety of research designs common in applied economic research. Because statistical agencies do not always report the methods they use to protect confidentiality, we also characterize settings in which statistical disclosure limitation methods are discoverable; that is, they can be learned from the released data. We conclude with advice for researchers, journal editors, and statistical agencies.},

	abstract = {The creation of public use data that combine variables from the Census Bureau's Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), the Internal Revenue Service's (IRS) individual lifetime earnings data, and the Social Security Administration's (SSA) individual benefit data began as part of ongoing collaborative research at the Census Bureau and SSA. The current project had its genesis with the formation of a joint committee containing representatives from the Census Bureau, SSA, IRS, and the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) that designed a prospective public use file. Aimed at a user community that was primarily interested in national retirement and disability programs, the selection of variables for the proposed SIPP/SSA/IRS-PUF focused on the critical demographic data to be supplied from the SIPP, earnings histories from the IRS data maintained at SSA, and benefit data from SSA’s master beneficiary records. After attempting to determine the feasibility of adding a limited number of variables from the SIPP directly to the linked earnings and benefit data, it was decided that the set of variables that could be added without compromising the confidentiality protection of the existing SIPP public use files was so limited that alternative methods had to be used to create a useful new public use file. The committee agreed to allow the Census Bureau to experiment with the confidentiality protection system known generically as "synthetic data." The actual technique adopted is called partially synthetic data with multiple imputation of missing items. As the term is used in this report, "partially synthetic data" means the release of person-level records containing some variables from the actual responses and other variables where the actual responses have been replaced by values sampled from the posterior predictive distribution for that record, conditional on all of the confidential data. This final report accompanies the delivery of version 4.0 to SSA as part of the fiscal year 2006 Jointly Financed Cooperative Agreement between the Census Bureau and SSA.},

Using Pareto estimation methods with less‐censored internal data, we create an enhanced cell‐mean series to capture top earnings in the public‐use data. Annual earnings inequality trends since 1963 using our series largely mirror those found by Kopczuk, Saez, and Song using social security administration data for commerce and industry workers. When we extend our analysis to 2013 and consider all workers, earnings inequality levels are higher but its growth is more modest. (

Another key aspect of the TDA are invariants, statistics that the Census Bureau has determined, as matter of policy, to exclude from the privacy-loss accounting. The TDA post-processes the measurements together with the invariants to produce a Microdata Detail File (MDF) that contains one record for each person and one record for each housing unit enumerated in the 2020 Census. The MDF is passed to the 2020 Census tabulation system to produce the 2020 Census Redistricting Data (P.L. 94-171) Summary File.

However, this rapid surge of technological capability also comes at a cost, as it leads to an increase in the complexity of software environments and potential compatibility issues across systems. Advanced workflows in processing or analysis often require specific software versions and operating systems to run smoothly, and discrepancies across machines and researchers can impede reproducibility and efficient collaboration. As a result, scientific teams are increasingly relying on containers to implement robust, dependable research ecosystems. Originally popularized in software engineering, containers have become common in scientific projects, particularly in large collaborative efforts. In this Primer, we describe what containers are, how they work and the rationale for their use in scientific projects. We review state-of-the-art implementations in diverse contexts and fields, with examples in various scientific fields. Finally, we discuss the possibilities enabled by the widespread adoption of containerization, especially in the context of open and reproducible research, and propose recommendations to facilitate seamless implementation across platforms and domains, including within high-performance computing clusters such as those typically available at universities and research institutes.},

Though computational reproducibility seems more straight forward than replicating physical experiments, the complex and rapidly changing nature of computer environments makes being able to reproduce and extend such work a serious challenge. In this paper, I explore common reasons that code developed for one research project cannot be successfully executed or extended by subsequent researchers. I review current approaches to these issues, including virtual machines and workflow systems, and their limitations. I then examine how the popular emerging technology Docker combines several areas from systems research - such as operating system virtualization, cross-platform portability, modular re-usable elements, versioning, and a 'DevOps' philosophy, to address these challenges. I illustrate this with several examples of Docker use with a focus on the R statistical environment.},

They have to share data in ways that protect privacy and confidentiality, are informative for many analyses and purposes, and are relatively straightforward to use by data analysts. One approach suggested in the literature is that data stewards generate and release synthetic data, i.e., data simulated from statistical models, while also providing users access to a verification server that allows them to assess the quality of inferences from the synthetic data. We present an application of the synthetic data plus verification server approach to longitudinal data on employees of the U.S. federal government. As part of the application, we present a novel model for generating synthetic career trajectories, as well as strategies for generating high dimensional, longitudinal synthetic datasets. We also present novel verification algorithms for regression coefficients that satisfy differential privacy. We illustrate the integrated use of synthetic data plus verification via analysis of differentials in pay by race. The integrated system performs as intended, allowing users to explore the synthetic data for potential pay differentials and learn through verifications which findings in the synthetic data hold up and which do not. The analysis on the confidential data reveals pay differentials across races not documented in published studies.},

	abstract = {Protecting confidential information is a major concern for organizations and individuals alike, who stand to suffer huge losses if private data falls into the wrong hands. One of the primary threats to confidentiality is malicious software on personal computers, which is estimated to already reside on 100 to 150 million machines. Current security controls, such as firewalls, anti-virus software, and intrusion detection systems, are inadequate at preventing malware infection. This paper introduces Storages Capsules, a new approach for protecting confidential files on a personal computer. Storage Capsules are encrypted file containers that allow a compromised machine to securely view and edit sensitive files without malware being able to steal confidential data. The system achieves this goal by taking a checkpoint of the current system state and disabling device output before allowing access a Storage Capsule. Writes to the Storage Capsule are then sent to a trusted module. When the user is done editing files in the Storage Capsule, the system is restored to its original state and device output resumes normally. Finally, the trusted module declassifies the Storage Capsule by re-encrypting its contents, and exports it for storage in a low-integrity environment. This work presents the design, implementation, and evaluation of Storage Capsules, with a focus on exploring covert channels.},

	abstract = {Couples’ earnings equality declines substantially following a first birth, when time commitments at home and on the labor market diverge. In the context of broad increases in gender equality and growing socioeconomic disparities along various dimensions of family life, we examine changes in within-family earnings equality following parenthood and the extent to which they have played out differently by mothers’ education. Our analysis relies on links between rich surveys and administrative tax records that provide high quality earnings data for husbands and wives spanning two years before and up to 10 years following cohorts of first births from the 1980s to the 2000s (Survey of Income and Program Participation Synthetic Beta files; N =131,400 married couples and 21,300 first birth transitions). We find that wives’ share of couple earnings declined after parenthood, changes were relatively modest over time, and these were mostly concentrated among the earliest cohort of parents. The magnitude of decline in her earnings share was substantial, dropping 13 percentage points following first birth in the 1980s and 10 percentage points in the 2000s, after accounting for time-invariant couple characteristics and year and age fixed effects. We find few differences in her earnings share changes over time by mother’s education, and we identify mothers’ employment as a key mechanism of change across education groups. Wives’ financial dependence on their husbands increases substantially after parenthood, irrespective of education and cohort, with implications for women’s vulnerability, particularly in the U.S. where divorce remains common and public support for families is weak.},

The findings indicate that a one month increase in the duration of unemployment reduces reemployment wages by 0.9\%.  The observed reduction in reemployment wages for older workers is mainly explained by the stigma effect ensued from prolonged unemployment spells.  The simulation exercise also suggests on the substantial effect of the stronger state age discrimination law on durations of unemployment and a very modest effect on wages; while, the 1983 Social Security reforms had a small impact on durations of  unemployment with no impact on wages of older workers.},

	abstract = {The Great Recession (2007‒2009) and its lingering aftermath have posed challenges to the state safety net programs that are intended to provide income supports to the economically disadvantaged. The stratified, decentralized structure of the U.S. social welfare system has contributed to uneven policy responses to economic hardship across programs and states. With a focus on the Unemployment Insurance (UI) and General Assistance (GA) programs, this dissertation consists of three papers that investigate (1) the impacts of state UI modernization, (2) state UI approaches to social protection, and (3) state legislative reform of GA, respectively. This dissertation takes a multidisciplinary approach that integrates theoretical perspectives and research methods from social welfare, sociology, political science, and economics. The first paper evaluates the effects of state UI modernization on the trajectories of household income-to-poverty levels during and after the Great Recession. It uses the nationally representative 2008 Survey of Income and Program Participation panel dataset (merged with state data) and multilevel growth models to test the policy effects from 2008 through 2013. Findings show that working families had not yet fully recovered from the Great Recession by the end of 2013. However, working families in states enacting UI modernization provisions, on average, experienced a greater economic improvement rate in the income-to-poverty level than their counterparts, controlling for state and household characteristics. The second paper classifies state UI policy approaches to social protection by using an advanced model-based clustering technique to analyze multidimensional policy design and performance characteristics of 51 UI programs. Results indicate two distinct state UI approaches to social protection for workers: high and low protection. The high-protection approach, compared to its low-protection counterpart, is characterized as combining high financing adequacy with high taxable wages and average tax rates; high program accessibility with inclusive eligibility criteria; and high wage replacement with high benefit levels. These two approaches remained comparatively stable over time. However, both showed a declining trend in the social protection performances from 2007 to 2014. The third paper employs a thematic content analysis of 26 legislative videos to examine how policy actors used knowledge to frame the problems of the poor and shape GA reform in Washington State. Findings show that knowledge construction of the GA-unemployable population as social deviants with psychological and behavioral problems influenced the GA reform directions toward a regulated, punitive model. These negative social constructions, intersecting with the mainstream welfare ideology of personal responsibility and work ethic, contributed to dismantling the safety net of last resort for the least resourceful poor. As a whole, this dissertation research contributes to the fields of state welfare politics, policies, and practice through enhancing the understanding of the connections among macroeconomic conditions, anti-poverty politics, policy designs, and the state safety net system. Policy implications for promoting economic justice for disadvantaged and marginalized populations are offered.},

Using nationally representative panel data from the 2008 survey of income and program participation, this study examined the relationship between state UI modernization and the growth trajectory of economic security among American working households. After controlling for state-level and household-level covariates, the results of the multilevel growth modeling showed that, on average, the state enactment of UI modernization provisions was associated with a faster improvement rate of household economic security over a five-and-a-half-year period. The findings have implications for future studies concerning UI provisions and household economic security.},

The model incorporates a reduced-form search model and allows for migration for non-market reasons. My estimates show that moving costs are substantial and that labor market frictions primarily inhibit migration of the employed. I use the model to study migration responses to local labor market shocks and to a moving subsidy. Workers' preferences for non-market amenities, coupled with substantial moving costs and employment frictions, grant market power to incumbent employers. Large moving costs also likely affect employers' recruiting behavior.},

The university increased basic life insurance holdings, which nudged employees with supplemental coverage to have more life insurance. In large part due to inertia, the nudge increased life insurance holdings one-for-one for those who could have undone it. Additionally, we find that expanding coverage options significantly increased total life insurance holdings for new hires who were not subject to inertia. These policy changes reduced uninsured vulnerabilities for two-thirds of employees. Our findings have important policy implications for addressing widespread disparities in life insurance coverage.

From July to September 2005, TennCare, the Tennessee Medicaid program, disenrolled approximately 170,000 adults following a change in eligibility rules. Following this eligibility change, the fraction of adults in Tennessee covered by Medicaid fell by over 5 percentage points while uninsured rates increased by almost 5 percentage points relative to adults in other Southern states. There is no evidence of an increase in employment rates in Tennessee following the disenrollment. Self-reported health and access to medical care worsened as hospitalization rates, doctor visits, and dentist visits all declined while the use of free or public clinics increased. The Tennessee experience suggests that undoing the expansion of Medicaid eligibility to adults that occurred under the Affordable Care Act likely would reduce health insurance coverage, reduce health care access, and worsen health but would not lead to increases in employment.},

A savings account may be associated with young-adult households’ reduced reliance on unproductive debt and their increased access to productive debt that can facilitate wealth building. This article tests the association between a savings account and debt in the lives of American young adults during periods of macroeconomic stability and decline. Owning a savings account in 1996 was associated with a 14 percent decrease (\$844) in young-adult households’ accumulated unsecured debt, while closing an account in 2008 was associated with a 12 percent increase (\$1,320) in this type of debt. Thus, a savings account may help young adults invest in their debt by entering better, healthier credit markets and protecting them from riskier ones, especially during bad economic times.},

In standard models, aggregate job reallocation depends on (a) the dispersion of idiosyncratic productivity shocks faced by businesses and (b) the marginal responsiveness of businesses to those shocks. Using several novel empirical facts from business microdata, we infer that the pervasive post-2000 decline in reallocation reflects weaker responsiveness in a manner consistent with rising adjustment frictions and not lower dispersion of shocks. The within-industry dispersion of TFP and output per worker has risen, while the marginal responsiveness of employment growth to business-level productivity has weakened. The responsiveness in the post-2000 period for young firms in the high-tech sector is only about half (in manufacturing) to two thirds (economy wide) of the peak in the 1990s. Counterfactuals show that weakening productivity responsiveness since 2000 accounts for a significant drag on a ggregate productivity.},

But most startups and young firms either fail or don’t create jobs. A small proportion of young firms grow rapidly and they account for the long lasting contribution of startups to job growth. High growth firms are not well understood in terms of either theory or evidence. Although the evidence of their role in job creation is mounting, little is known about their life cycle dynamics, or their contribution to other key outcomes such as real output growth and productivity. In this paper, we enhance the Longitudinal Business Database with gross output (real revenue) measures. We find that the patterns for high output growth firms largely mimic those for high employment growth firms. High growth output firms are disproportionately young and make disproportionate contributions to output and productivity growth. The share of activity accounted for by high growth output and employment firms varies substantially across industries – in the post 2000 period the share of activity accounted for by high growth firms is significantly higher in the High Tech and Energy related industries. A firm in a small business intensive industry is less likely to be a high output growth firm but small business intensive industries don’t have significantly smaller shares of either employment or output activity accounted for by high growth firms.},

Previous research has primarily relied on cross-sectional data and thus has been unable to disentangle changes in assortative mating from changes in the division of spouses’ paid labor—a potentially key mechanism given the dramatic rise in wives’ labor supply. We use data from the Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) to decompose the increase in the correlation between spouses’ earnings and its contribution to inequality between 1970 and 2013 into parts due to (a) changes in assortative mating, and (b) changes in the division of paid labor. Contrary to what has often been assumed, the rise of economic homogamy and its contribution to inequality is largely attributable to changes in the division of paid labor rather than changes in sorting on earnings or earnings potential. Our findings indicate that the rise of economic homogamy cannot be explained by hypotheses centered on meeting and matching opportunities, and they show where in this process inequality is generated and where it is not.},

Moreover, disability discrimination laws can affect nondisabled older workers because they are fairly likely to develop work-related disabilities, but are generally not protected by these laws. Using state variation in disability discrimination protections, we find little or no evidence that stronger disability discrimination laws lower the hiring of nondisabled older workers.

encouraging exit of less productive firms and freeing up skilled labor to be used for R\&D by high-type incumbents. Subsidies to the R\&D of incumbents do not achieve this objective

We find an enormous dispersion of management practices across plants, with 40 percent of this variation across plants within the same firm. Management practices account for more than 20 percent of the variation in productivity, a similar, or greater, percentage as that accounted for by R\&D, ICT, or human capital. We find evidence of two key drivers to improve management. The business environment, as measured by right-to-work laws, boosts incentive management practices. Learning spillovers, as measured by the arrival of large "Million Dollar Plants" in the country, increase the management scores of incumbents.},

I quantitatively illustrate these insights by evaluating two policies: an expansion of and the elimination of the H-1B visa program for skilled labor. A change in policy changes firms’ entry and exit decisions as they dynamically respond to changes in market size. The dynamic response of firms amplifies changes in relative wages as labor demand shifts with the distribution of firms. Firms’ responses also lead to the rapid accrual of aggregate gains/losses in output and consumption. The welfare implications of policy changes depend critically on who bears the burden of creating new firms.},

Specifically, do children with stay-at-home mothers have higher adult earnings than children raised in households with a working mother? The major contribution of our study is that, unlike previous studies, we have access to rich longitudinal data that allows us to measure both the parental earnings when the child is very young and the adult earnings of the child. Our findings are consistent with previous studies that show insignificant differences between children raised by stay-at-home mothers during their early years and children with mothers working in the market. We find no impact of maternal employment during the first five years of a child’s life on earnings, employment, or mobility measures of either sons or daughters. We do find, however, that maternal employment during children’s high school years is correlated with a higher probability of employment as adults for daughters and a higher correlation between parent and daughter earnings ranks.},

This is well above the proportion considered to be below the income poverty line (18.4\%). Children were more likely to live in households experiencing material hardship than seniors.},

This article explores some underlying dynamics of this phenomenon, referred to here as “\$2-a-day poverty,” presenting evidence from both qualitative fieldwork and quantitative analysis of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). The rise in \$2-a-day poverty has been concentrated among children experiencing it chronically—that is, for seven or more months during a calendar year. Both qualitative and quantitative evidence find that a large majority of children experiencing \$2-a-day poverty live in households where an adult worked during the year, while only a small proportion live in households accessing TANF. Finally, households experiencing \$2-a-day poverty appear to be more likely to face material hardships than other low-income households.},

Common imputation methods used to recover top-coded income values are limited in several ways when applied to longitudinal data. I show that the accuracy of imputed income values for top earners in longitudinal surveys can be improved significantly by incorporating information from multiple time periods into the imputation process in a simple way. Moreover, I introduce an innovative, nonparametric empirical Bayes imputation method that further improves imputation quality. With a sample of individuals for whom incomes are pseudo top-coded (i.e., in which the exact income figures are accessible but temporarily expunged), I show that the Bayesian imputation method reduces the root mean squared error of imputed income values by 19-46\% relative to standard approaches in the literature. After documenting this improvement in performance, I illustrate the benefits of the Bayesian method for investigating multi-year income inequality.},

Using nationally representative panels from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) from 1984 to 2007, we show that the economic consequences of divorce have declined since the 1980s owing to the growth in married women’s earnings and their receipt of child support and income from personal networks. In contrast, the economic consequences of cohabitation dissolution were modest in the 1980s but have worsened over time. Cohabiting mothers’ income losses associated with union dissolution now closely resemble those of divorced mothers. These trends imply that changes in marital stability have not contributed to rising income instability among families with children, but trends in the extent and economic costs of cohabitation have likely contributed to rising income instability for less-advantaged children.},

We study the trend in insecurity from 1984–2010 by analyzing fluctuations in children’s monthly family incomes in the Survey of Income and Program Participation. Going beyond earlier research on income volatility, we examine income insecurity more directly by analyzing income gains and losses separately and by relating them to changes in family composition and employment. The analysis provides new evidence of increased income insecurity by showing that large income losses increased more than large income gains for low-income children. Nearly one-half the increase in extreme income losses is related to trends in single parenthood and parental employment. Large income losses proliferated with the increased incidence of very low incomes (less than \$150 per month). Extreme income losses and very low monthly incomes became more common particularly for U.S. children of nonworking single parents from the mid-1990s.},

We find that liquid and illiquid assets and secured debts are associated with a decrease in the likelihood of dissolution, and that large unsecured debts are associated with an increase. These associations do not differ significantly for married and cohabiting couples. We find evidence of both the material and the symbolic importance of wealth for stability.

Individuals moving in and out of the labor force have been an understudied margin of labor supply but account for 20–40\% of the decline in participation between 1984 and 2011. In-and-outs are distinct from unemployed individuals, experiencing no loss of future income as a result of their time out of the labor force, and represent a distinct margin of labor supply from long-term labor force dropouts. Examining explanations for the rise of in-and-outs, I find little evidence to suggest that changes in labor demand are responsible.},

Our approach exploits two dimensions of the data we analyze. First, we compare individuals in states that were fully bound by the 2007 to 2009 increases in the federal minimum wage to individuals in states that were not. Second, we use variation in the minimum wage's bite across skill groups to separate our samples into “target” and “within-state control” groups. Using the 2008 panel of the Survey of Income and Program Participation, we find that binding minimum wage increases had significant, negative effects on the employment and income growth of targeted workers. Although there are important limitations to our research designs, our estimates are robust to adopting a range of alternative strategies to construct our analysis samples and to account for variation in the Great Recession's underlying severity across states. In aggregate, our estimates suggest that this period's minimum wage increases reduced aggregate employment rates by at least half of a percentage point in states that were bound by the federal minimum wage increases. Because our estimates are large relative to what one would infer from past research, we emphasize the relevance of the historical episode we analyze.},

Using data on all nonfarm businesses from 1982–2013, we ﬁnd that new and young ﬁrms (ages 0 to 5 years) account for almost one-half of growth — three times their share of employment. Large established ﬁrms contribute only one-tenth of growth despite representing one-fourth of employment. Older ﬁrms do explain most of the speedup and slowdown during the middle of our sample.

While there has been considerable scholarly and policy interest in the effects of this mandate on health insurance coverage among young adults, there has been little scholarly work measuring the costs and incidence of this mandate and who pays the costs of it. In our empirical work, we exploit the fact that some states had dependent care mandates in years prior to the passage of the ACA. Using data from the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP), we find that workers at firms with employer-based coverage – whether or not they have dependent children – experience an annual reduction in wages of approximately \$1,200. Our results imply that the marginal costs of mandated employer-based coverage expansions are not entirely borne only by the people whose coverage is expanded by the mandate.},

	abstract = {The U.S. is undergoing a long-term decline in the rate of ﬁrm startups. We ﬁnd that this slowdown in entrepreneurship is more pronounced for skilled individuals. In particular, between 1983 and 2006 the entry rate into entrepreneurship declined by 11\% for those with at least a college degree and increased by 18\% for those with a high school degree or some college experience. We posit that this skill biased entrepreneurial decline is a response to the changing income structure of workers and entrepreneurs that occurred over the same period. We show that entrepreneurial income grew more slowly than worker’s income for skilled individuals while for unskilled individuals both incomes grew at relatively similar rates. To quantify the impact of income structure on entrepreneurial entry we present a simple heterogeneous-agent occupational choice model, which takes as given a rising worker skill premium, driven by skill biased technical change. In the model, the rising worker skill premium can account for around two-thirds of the changes in entry among skilled and unskilled individuals between 1983 and 2006. This paper contributes to understanding the forces behind the broader decline in business dynamism in the U.S. and suggests an integral role of the rising income inequality in driving this phenomenon.},

	abstract = {The option to claim Social Security before the full retirement age (FRA) has been around for over 50 years. But claiming benefits early has an inherent trade-off: more years of income are received in exchange for an actuarially reduced monthly benefit. The actuarial reduction is designed to be “fair” for the average worker in that, regardless of the age at which a person claims, he can expect to receive the same expected present value (EPV) of his lifetime benefits. Aside from a period of high interest rates in the 1980s, this equality has roughly held for the average worker since the inception of the actuarial reduction. But the key word here is average. Workers who live less long than the average might maximize the EPV of benefits by claiming early, while those who live longer than average might benefit more from delay. This paper analyzes this issue by calculating the EPV of Social Security benefits by race, education, and gender, all three of which are correlates of both mortality and earnings.},

We first document these relationships using data from the 1986 to 2008 waves of the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP). We then exploit variation in laws governing divorce across states and over time to quasi-experimentally identify how the timing of an exogenous increase in divorce risk (that is, the introduction of unilateral divorce) impacts employment and retirement outcomes for older women. The spread of unilateral divorce, we find, was associated with cross-cohort differences in the probability of divorce over the lifecycle. For women with a low risk of divorce, later exposure to unilateral divorce significantly increases the probability of full-time employment later in life, and significantly decreases retirement wealth. This finding suggests that ever-divorced women are working longer remedially; when a woman unexpectedly divorces later in life, she is less likely to have engaged in precautionary human capital investment and might have to work longer to increase her assets prior to retirement. For women with a high risk of divorce, later exposure to increases in divorce risk does not impact full-time employment after age 50 but is positively associated with investment in education post marriage. These women invest more in their own human capital within marriage, which might insure them against increases in exogenous divorce risk at later ages.},

Using a panel of Compustat firms from 1964 to 2013 we find that, in addition to the well-documented counter cyclicality in dispersion, the third moment---skewness---is strongly pro cyclical. This happens because the distribution of negative growth rates expands during recessions while the distribution of positive growth rates changes little. In fact, this pattern---of lower tail greatly expanding during recessions---is also the main driver behind the counter cyclicality of dispersion. These results are robust to different selection criteria, across firm size categories, and across industries. We also analyze the distribution of macroeconomic outcomes such as GDP growth and stock returns using a panel of developed and developing countries.

	url = {https://ideas.repec.org/p/cen/wpaper/19-27.html},
	abstract = {Most applied research in labor economics that examines returns to worker skills or differences in earnings across subgroups of workers typically accounts for the role of occupations by controlling for occupational categories. Researchers often aggregate detailed occupations into categories based on the Standard Occupation Classification (SOC) coding scheme, which is based largely on narratives or qualitative measures of workers’ tasks. Alternatively, we propose two quantitative task-based approaches to constructing occupational categories by using factor analysis with O*NET job descriptors that provide a rich set of continuous measures of job tasks across all occupations. We find that our task-based approach outperforms the SOC-based approach in terms of lower occupation distance measures. We show that our task-based approach provides an intuitive, nuanced interpretation for grouping occupations and permits quantitative assessments of similarities in task compositions across occupations. We also replicate a recent analysis and find that our task-based occupational categories explain more of the gender wage gap than the SOC-based approaches explain. Our study enhances the Federal Statistical System’s understanding of the SOC codes, investigates ways to use third-party data to construct useful research variables that can potentially be added to Census Bureau data products to improve their quality and versatility, and sheds light on how the use of alternative occupational categories in economics research may lead to different empirical results and deeper understanding in the analysis of labor market outcomes.},

	abstract = {US entrepreneurs typically work long hours in their  rms and these hours form a large part of the  rms' labor input. This paper studies the role of endogenous owner hours in shaping the wealth distribution among entrepreneurs. We introduce owners' endogenous labor supply into a model of entrepreneurial choice and  nancial frictions. The model  ts well the levels and the dispersion of wealth among entrepreneurs. Long owner hours incentivize poor, highly productive individuals to be owners and help the most productive owners to accumulate large quantities of wealth. On net, owners working long hours decreases the median owner wealth and increase wealth dispersion among owners. Di erently, the ability to work su ciently short hours incentivizes owners to run low productivity  rms with high wealth to income ratios. Finally, alternative calibrations ignoring the endogenous labor supply of owners lead to owners that are much richer than in the data and overstate the e ect of  nancial frictions in the economy.},

Differences in occupation-specific flexibility, disciplined with the observed patterns in hours (level, persistence, dispersion) and income (persistence, dispersion), can explain relatively low income levels of entrepreneurs in the US and the occupation-specific distributions of working hours and income. Policy relevance of the model features is discussed using experiments of workweek restrictions and income taxation.},

To understand these facts, a dynamic model of entrepreneurship is constructed, where individuals can become entrepreneurs, or work in either a corporate or an entrepreneurial sector. Sectoral differences in production technology, financial constraints, and labor market frictions lead to sector-specific wages and worker sorting into the entrepreneurial sector by productivity and assets. Individuals with lower assets tend to accept jobs in the entrepreneurial sector, an implication that finds support in the data. The analysis indicates that sector-specific labor market frictions are critical to the model's ability to generate worker sorting and to match the key features of the entrepreneurial sector.},

"Gazelles" -- a small subset of startups with particularly high growth potential --  emerge as key drivers of these outcomes. Analyzing changes in the distribution of ex-ante firm heterogeneity over time reveals that the birth rate and growth potential of gazelles has declined, creating substantial aggregate losses.},

We also find that item nonresponse is more strongly correlated with earnings in the SOEP than traditional measures of either IQ or Conscientiousness. We also use the Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) Gold Standard, which has no explicit measure of either cognitive or non-cognitive ability, to show that item nonresponse predicts earnings from self-reported and administrative sources. Consistent with previous work showing that Conscientiousness and IQ are positively associated with longevity, we document that item nonresponse is associated with decreased mortality risk.

We also ﬁnd that couples’ earnings instability is lower in levels compared to male earnings instability and actually declines in these data.

Similar changes in other highly-skilled occupations have occurred throughout the U.S. economy during the last 50 years. Given that the innate talent for these professions is unlikely to have changed differently across groups, the change in the occupational distribution since 1960 suggests that a substantial pool of innately talented women and black men in 1960 were not pursuing their comparative advantage. We examine the effect on aggregate productivity of the convergence in the occupational distribution between 1960 and 2010 through the prism of a Roy model. Across our various speciﬁcations, between 20\% and 40\% of growth in aggregate market output per person can be explained by the improved allocation of talent.},

We infer this from the modest employment share of entering ﬁrms (deﬁned as those less than 5 years old). Second, most growth seems to occur through improvements of existing varieties rather than creation of brand new varieties. Third, own-product improvements by incumbents appear to be more important than creative destruction. We infer this because the distribution of job creation and destruction has thinner tails than implied by a model with a dominant role for creative destruction.},

Extended family households have very unequal monetary contributions toward household rent and utilities, although Hispanics have less unequal monetary contributions when compared with other racial groups. Hispanic and Asian extended family households experience decreasing inequality in financial contributions as the income of each family increases, whereas no relationship between financial contributions and income is found for Whites or Blacks.

Our focus is on redistribution across race and education groups. The cohorts we study are younger than cohorts studied in previous, similar research and thus more exposed to recent increases in earnings inequality. All else equal, this should increase the degree of progressivity of Social Security redistribution due to the structure of the benefit formula. However, we find that redistribution is only modestly progressive for individuals born as late as 1980. Differential mortality rates across race and education groups are the primary explanation. While Black–White mortality gaps have narrowed some in recent years, they remain large and dull progressivity. Mortality gaps by education level are also large and unlike the gaps by race, they are widening, which puts additional regressive pressure on Social Security redistribution.},

Employment fluctuations of startups are procyclical, they persist into later years, and cohort-level employment variations are largely driven by differences in firm size, rather than the number of firms. An estimated general equilibrium firm dynamics model reveals that aggregate conditions at birth, rather than post-entry choices, drive the majority of cohort-level employment variation by affecting the share of startups with high growth potential. In the aggregate, changes in startup conditions result in large, slow-moving fluctuations in employment.

	abstract = {My dissertation examines the effects that US Social Security policy changes have on labor supply and application behavior. In my first chapter, I use survey data matched to administrative records to measure the effect of a natural experiment in the provision of information - the introduction of the Social Security Statement - on Social Security Disability Insurance (DI) application behavior. I find that receipt of the Statement, a document gradually introduced in the 1990s which contained personalized information on all Social Security benefits, had a positive, substantial, and statistically significant effect on DI application, amounting to a 62\% increase over the base rate. The overall effect was entirely driven by individuals reporting a work-limiting condition who were previously not employed. Furthermore, my analysis shows no evidence of applicants "shifting forward" their DI application. In the absence of these new applicants, the 32\% growth rate of the per-capita DI rolls from 1995-2004 would have been approximately 25\%, a 20\% drop. My second chapter examines the impact of the Statement on individuals approaching retirement who are still working. I find that the effects are mixed: individuals working few hours per week prior to Statement receipt markedly increase their hours worked, while those working full time or more decrease their hours. However, it appears that individuals misunderstood that the Statement provided a retirement benefit projection based on constant earnings going forward. After second Statement receipt, those who previously decreased their labor supply then increased it. My third chapter uses program interactions between the two federal disability programs - DI and Supplemental Security Income - to estimate labor supply elasticities of DI beneficiaries. Given wide variation in SSI state supplements temporally and geographically and temporal variation in DI parameters, otherwise similar DI beneficiaries may face a 50\% or 0\% disability benefit reduction rate. This variation in marginal rate allows for a direct calculation of labor supply responsiveness to such a rate change. My elasticity estimates - the first for US disability beneficiaries based on differences in benefit reduction rates - are inelastic and low, ranging from -0.14 to -0.36 for the participation elasticity.},

In this paper we use longitudinal administrative data from over 70,000 individuals in the Synthetic SIPP Beta to examine the earnings gap between mothers and non-mothers over the lifecycle and between cohorts. We observe women who never have children beginning to out earn women who will have children during their 20s. Gaps increase monotonically over the lifecycle, and decrease monotonically between cohorts from age 26 onwards. In our oldest cohort, lifetime gaps approach \$350,000 by age 62. Cumulative labor market experience profiles show similar patterns, with experience gaps between mothers and non-mothers generally increasing over the lifecycle and decreasing between cohorts. We decompose this cumulative gap in earnings (up to age 43) into portions attributable to time spent out of the labor force, differing levels of education, years of marriage and a number of demographic controls. We find that this gap between mothers and non-mothers declines from around \$220,000 for women born in the late 1940s to around \$160,000 for women born in the late 1960s. Over 80\% of the change in this gap can be explained by variables in our model, with changes in labor force participation by far the best explanation for the declining gap. Comparing our oldest cohort as they approach retirement to the projected lifecycle behavior of the 1965 cohort, we find that the earnings gap is estimated to drop from \$350,000 (observed) to \$282,000 (expected) and that the experience gap drops from 3.7 to 2.1 years. We also explore the intensive margin costs of having a child. A decomposition of earnings gaps between mothers of one child and mothers of two children also controls for age at first birth.

	abstract = {In this paper we examine the earnings covariance matrix generated from a ten-year time series and estimate a variance components model that parameterizes the process generating earnings. We use our estimated variance components to test key hypotheses concerning life-cycle human capital investment and labor supply separately for men and women. Hu- man capital investment models predict that individuals with higher initial earnings have lower growth rates of earnings and that earnings follow a random growth model with individual specific rates of growth due to experience. Life-cycle labor supply models predict that variation in individual productivity affects earnings more than hours supplied. In order to test these hypotheses, we look for permanent individual variance components in the growth rate of earnings and significant auto-correlation in earnings overtime. We also test for the presence of a common component of variation between hours and earnings and explore how this component contributes to earnings relative to hours. We look for evidence to support or contradict the predictions of the models using a new data source â€” a set of SIPP panels linked to administrative tax data on labor market earnings. Our data contain Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) respondents from the five panels conducted by the Census Bureau in the 1990s with linked W-2 wage records filed by employers with the IRS. The sum of these wage records for a given year provides an uncapped annual earnings measure. We use survey information on the number of weeks worked full-time and part-time in a year to estimate annual hours worked. Because of the length of the time period covered (1990-1999), the size of the sample (approximately 230,000 individuals), and the high quality of the earnings measure, these data offer a unique opportunity to re-visit several classic labor economics questions and provide fresh evidence for on-going debate.},

	abstract = {The U.S. government subsidizes retirement saving through 401(k) plans with 61.4 billion in tax expenditures annually, but the question of whether these tax incentives are effective in increasing saving remains unanswered. Using longitudinal U.S. Social Security Administration data on tax-deferred earnings linked to the Survey of Income and Program Participation, the project examines whether the â€œcatch-up provision,â€� which was enacted in 2001 and allows workers over age 50 to contribute more to their 401(k) plans, has been effective in increasing earnings deferrals. Compared with similar workers under age 50, the study finds that contributions increased by 540 more among age-50-plus individuals who had approached the 401(k) tax-deferral limits prior to turning 50, suggesting that the older individuals respond to the expanded tax incentives. For this group, the elasticity of retirement savings to the tax incentive is quite high: a one-dollar increase in the tax-deferred limit leads to an immediate 49-cent increase in 401(k) contributions.},

	abstract = {This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics. The first chapter looks at whether the Social Security claiming behavior of husbands respond to the presence of Social Security spouse and survivor benefits paid to wives based on his earnings record. I separately estimate the claiming response to incentives for each of the three types of Social Security benefits: retired worker, spousal, and survivor. This approach departs from the previous literature, which estimates behavioral responses to household incentives. I begin by documenting that failure to maximize household Social Security wealth results in a financial burden borne primarily by the wife. I next estimate husbands' behavioral response to Social Security benefit incentives, with my focus exclusively upon incentives due to the actuarial adjustment from delayed claiming. Variation in incentives comes from rule changes to the Social Security benefit calculation, in addition to the age difference between spouses and the relative strength of the wife's labor force history. I find while husbands are responsive to their own benefit incentives, they are barely responsive to household, spousal, and survivor benefit incentives. A variety of robustness checks looking at segments of the population predicted to be more responsive to incentives provide very similar results to main specification. The second chapter examines the incidence of health insurance coverage for displaced workers during the periods preceding and subsequent to job displacement. Most individuals lose health insurance coverage upon job separation. There is concern that individuals are unable to recover insurance coverage following separation. I find within 18 months following job loss the level of health insurance coverage returns to pre-displacement level. Furthermore, I find that obtaining insurance coverage upon reemployment does not impact wages. The third chapter first examines how much of the fall in poverty among elderly women can be attributed to changes in the distributions of age, marital status, and education of elderly women using the Current Population Survey. Increased educational attainment has put tremendous downward pressure on the poverty rate driven primarily by the shift of high school dropouts to those with a high school diploma. I also find poverty would be slightly lower in the absence of changes to the age distribution and no direct impact on poverty levels due to the changes in distribution of marital status. I also investigate the role of both labor force participation and marital status over the life-cycle on old age outcomes using survey data matched to administrative earnings records from the Census Bureau. I find even after controlling for Social Security and marital status over prime-age years, lifetime earnings and labor force experience still has a significant impact on poverty incidence of elderly women. Projecting poverty for cohorts who have not reached old age, I find increased wages and LFP over the life-cycle places large downward pressure on predicted poverty. Marital status over the life-cycle exerts its own negative impact on poverty.},

We show that the distribution of the share of income earned by the wife exhibits a sharp drop to the right of 12, where the wifeâ€™s income exceeds the husbandâ€™s income.

We present evidence that this aversion also impacts marriage formation, the wifeâ€™s labor force participation, the wifeâ€™s income conditional on working, marriage satisfaction, likelihood of divorce, and the division of home production. Within marriage markets, when a randomly chosen woman becomes more likely to earn more than a randomly chosen man, marriage rates decline.

In many contexts, data contain sensitive values which cannot be released in their original form in order to protect individuals' privacy. Synthetic data is a protection method that releases alternative values in place of the original ones, and differential privacy (DP) is a formal guarantee for quantifying the privacy loss. We propose a method that maximizes the distributional similarity of the synthetic data relative to the original data using a measure known as the pMSE, while guaranteeing \$\${\textbackslash}epsilon \$\$-DP. We relax common DP assumptions concerning the distribution and boundedness of the original data. We prove theoretical results for the privacy guarantee and provide simulations for the empirical failure rate of the theoretical results under typical computational limitations. We give simulations for the accuracy of linear regression coefficients generated from the synthetic data compared with the accuracy of non-DP synthetic data and other DP methods. Additionally, our theoretical results extend a prior result for the sensitivity of the Gini Index to include continuous predictors.},

This paper is concerned with methods to judge whether such synthetic data have a distribution that is comparable to that of the original data, what we will term general utility. We consider how general utility compares with specific utility, the similarity of results of analyses from the synthetic data and the original data. We adapt a previous general measure of data utility, the propensity score mean-squared-error (pMSE), to the specific case of synthetic data and derive its distribution for the case when the correct synthesis model is used to create the synthetic data. Our asymptotic results are confirmed by a simulation study. We also consider two specific utility measures, confidence interval overlap and standardized difference in summary statistics, which we compare with the general utility results. We present two examples examining this comparison of general and specific utility to real data syntheses and make recommendations for their use for evaluating synthetic data.},

	url = {http://www.jstor.org/stable/2246252},
	abstract = {Conducting sample surveys, imputing incomplete observations, and analyzing the resulting data are three indispensable phases of modern practice with public-use data files and with many other statistical applications. Each phase inherits different input, including the information preceding it and the intellectual assessments available, and aims to provide output that is one step closer to arriving at statistical inferences with scientific relevance. However, the role of the imputation phase has often been viewed as merely providing computational convenience for users of data. Although facilitating computation is very important, such a viewpoint ignores the imputer's assessments and information inaccessible to the users. This view underlies the recent controversy over the validity of multiple-imputation inference when a procedure for analyzing multiply imputed data sets cannot be derived from (is "uncongenial" to) the model adopted for multiple imputation. Given sensible imputations and complete-data analysis procedures, inferences from standard multiple-imputation combining rules are typically superior to, and thus different from, users' incomplete-data analyses. The latter may suffer from serious nonresponse biases because such analyses often must rely on convenient but unrealistic assumptions about the nonresponse mechanism. When it is desirable to conduct inferences under models for nonresponse other than the original imputation model, a possible alternative to recreating imputations is to incorporate appropriate importance weights into the standard combining rules. These points are reviewed and explored by simple examples and general theory, from both Bayesian and frequentist perspectives, particularly from the randomization perspective. Some convenient terms are suggested for facilitating communication among researchers from different perspectives when evaluating multiple-imputation inferences with uncongenial sources of input.},

	abstract = {This paper explores the consequences for economic research of methods used by statistical agencies to protect confidentiality of their respondents. We first review the concepts of statistical disclosure limitation for an audience of economists who may be unfamiliar with these methods. Our main objective is to shed light on the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for empirical economic research. In general, the standard approach of ignoring statistical disclosure limitation leads to incorrect inference. We formalize statistical disclosure methods in a model of the data publication process. In the model, the statistical agency collects data from a population, but published a version of the data that have been intentionally distorted. The model allows us to characterize what it means for statistical disclosure limitation to be ignorable, and to characterize what happens when it is not. We then consider the effects of statistical disclosure limitation for regression analysis, instrumental variable analysis, and regression discontinuity design. Because statistical agencies do not always report the methods they use to protect confidentiality, we use our model to characterize settings in which statistical disclosure limitation methods are discoverable; that is, they can be learned from the released data. We conclude with advice for researchers, journal editors, and statistical agencies.},

Although most people agree that computational reproducibility is important, it is still difficult to achieve in practice. In this article, the authors describe their approach to enabling computational reproducibility for the 12 articles in this special issue of Socius about the Fragile Families Challenge. The approach draws on two tools commonly used by professional software engineers but not widely used by academic researchers: software containers (e.g., Docker) and cloud computing (e.g., Amazon Web Services). These tools made it possible to standardize the computing environment around each submission, which will ease computational reproducibility both today and in the future. Drawing on their successes and struggles, the authors conclude with recommendations to researchers and journals.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science'' programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

Recent studies suggest, however, that sharing code and data does not suffice for computational reproducibility —defined as the ability of researchers to reproduce “par- ticular analysis outcomes from the same data set using the same code and software” (Fidler and Wilcox, 2018). To date, creating long-term computationally reproducible code has been technically challenging and time-consuming. This tutorial introduces Code Ocean, a cloud-based computational reproducibility platform that attempts to solve these problems. It does this by adapting software engineering tools, such as Docker, for easier use by scientists and scientific audiences. In this article, we first outline arguments for the importance of computational reproducibility, as well as some reasons why this is a nontrivial problem for researchers. We then provide a step-by-step guide to getting started with containers in research using Code Ocean. (Disclaimer: the authors all worked for Code Ocean at the time of this article’s writing.)},

It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way.\&nbsp;Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid. Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

For those who share their data, we mainly confirmed the initial results reported in the respective articles in roughly 70\% of the times. Only roughly 5\% of the articles yielded significantly different results from those reported in the publication.

Many journals are revising author guidelines to include data and code availability. This work evaluates the effectiveness of journal policy that requires the data and code necessary for reproducibility be made available postpublication by the authors upon request. We assess the effectiveness of such a policy by (i) requesting data and code from authors and (ii) attempting replication of the published findings. We chose a random sample of 204 scientific papers published in the journal Science after the implementation of their policy in February 2011. We found that we were able to obtain artifacts from 44\% of our sample and were able to reproduce the findings for 26\%.

            Journals have pushed for transparency of research through data availability policies. Such data policies improve availability of data and code, but what is the impact on reproducibility? We present results from a large reproduction exercise for articles published in the American Economic Journal: Applied Economics, which has had a data availability policy since its inception in 2009. Out of 363 published articles, we assessed 274 articles. All articles provided some materials. We excluded 122 articles that required confidential or proprietary data or that required the replicator to otherwise obtain the data (44.5\% of assessed articles). We attempted to reproduce 152 articles and were able to fully reproduce the results of 68 (44.7\% of attempted reproductions). A further 66 (43.4\% of attempted reproductions) were partially reproduced. Many articles required complex code changes even when at least partially reproduced. We collect bibliometric characteristics of authors, but find no evidence for author characteristics as determinants of reproducibility. There does not appear to be a citation bonus for reproducibility. The data availability policy of this journal was effective to ensure availability of materials, but is insufficient to ensure reproduction without additional work by replicators.

            Résumé
              Les journaux militent pour la transparence de la recherche par le biais de politiques sur la disponibilité des données
              . De telles politiques sur les données améliorent la disponibilité des données et du code, mais quelle en est l'incidence sur la reproductibilité? Nous présentons les résultats d'un grand exercice de reproduction pour des articles publiés dans le
              American Economic Journal: Applied Economics
              , qui a une politique de disponibilité des données depuis sa création en 2009. Parmi les 363 articles publiés, nous en évaluons 274. Tous les articles avaient fourni certains documents. Nous avons exclu 122 articles qui nécessitaient des données confidentielles ou exclusives, ou qui exigeaient que la personne chargée de la réplication obtienne autrement les données (44,5\% des articles évalués). Nous avons tenté de reproduire 152 articles et avons réussi à entièrement reproduire les résultats de 68 articles (44,7\% des reproductions tentées). Nous avons aussi partiellement reproduit 66 autres articles (43,4\% des reproductions tentées). De nombreux articles nécessitaient de complexes changements de code, même lorsqu'ils étaient au moins partiellement reproduits. Nous avons recueilli les caractéristiques bibliométriques des auteurs, mais n'avons pas constaté qu'elles étaient déterminantes pour la reproductibilité. La reproductibilité ne semble offrir aucun avantage en matière de citations. La politique de disponibilité des données de ce journal a été efficace pour assurer la disponibilité des documents, mais insuffisante pour assurer la reproduction sans travail supplémentaire des personnes chargées de la réplication.},
