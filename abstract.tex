I describe past experience with the validation server process over 10 years and several hundred users, as a means to provide proxy access to confidential data. As a modern replacement, I propose the use of containers --- simulated computers that encapsulate entire software and file structures. The use of containers ensures reproducibility, reliable portability, and enables scalability. Infrastructure can be outsourced to commercial providers or users, at little to no cost to data providers. The only likely limitation to full automation is the absence of automated output vetting algorithms at statistical agencies.
